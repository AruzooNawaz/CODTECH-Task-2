Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The user is prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation, after which the program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

Technology Used:

    Java Programming Language:
        Java is a widely-used programming language that is platform-independent, object-oriented, and suitable for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop to web to mobile applications.
        This project is written in Java, leveraging its standard libraries for input and output operations.

    Java Standard Library (java.util.Scanner):
        The Scanner class from the java.util package is used to read user input from the console. It provides methods to read various data types, including integers, doubles, and strings.

Key Features of the Simple Calculator Project:

    User-Friendly Input:
        Prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation.
        Utilizes the Scanner class to capture and process user input from the console.

    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        Supports the four basic arithmetic operations:
            Addition: Adds two numbers.
            Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
            Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
            Division: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.

    Simple and Clear User Interface:
        Provides clear instructions for users to follow.
        Displays the result of the chosen arithmetic operation in a straightforward manner.
